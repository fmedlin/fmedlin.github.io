Ben Northrop wrote about [Reflections of an “Old” Programmer](http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2016/reflections-of-an-old-programmer.php) which isn’t really about ageism, but rather how a long term programming career seems different than other professional careers. The message is how to stay relevant in a programming career over a long period of time. He sees it as a balance between knowledge decay and knowledge accumulation rate.

It reminds me of [Sarah Bray’s](http://sarahjbray.com/) concept that you can measure progress by [growing faster than you shrink](http://gatherthepeople.com/we-measure-our-progress/). Ben’s *grow* is knowledge accumulation rate. The *shrink* is knowledge decay. He suggests **taking a long view** on career choices in order to accumulate the right kinds of knowledge to give your career legs.

That title of Sr. Developer or Manager means you will spend more time becoming a leader, helping junior devs, reviewing code, attending meetings, etc. So much in fact, that Ben warns:

> All of this is eminently reasonable, but it comes, subtly, at the expense of our knowledge accumulation rate.

This is a topic also explored by [Cal Newton](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/): *Shallow work stops you from getting fired, but deep work is what gets you hired.*

Northrop reminds us to invest our limited time learning *durable knowledge*; concepts like algorithms, security and performance optimization that have a longer half-life than say, an unproven JS framework.

There are some relevant frameworks for how to think about relevant, future knowledge.

* Uncle Bob’s [Type Wars](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/05/01/TypeWars.html) post looks at motivations of past programming languages in order to predict future winners.
* Thoughtwork’s [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) is a detailed identification of  promising tech trends. There are also [several](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html) [opinions](https://github.com/bdargan/techradar) on building personal technology radars.
* As you would expect, there are [so](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Choosing-Your-Javascript-Framework) [many](http://redmonk.com/fryan/2016/09/16/language-framework-popularity-a-look-at-javascript/) [resources](https://www.codeschool.com/beginners-guide-to-web-development/single-page-applications) about how to choose a JS framework.

## Takeaways

1. Take a long view and consider sacrificing short term salary gains for long term career stability by investing in durable knowledge and skills.
2. Use a technology radar to focus on and discover durable knowledge.
3. Grow faster than you shrink. 😉
