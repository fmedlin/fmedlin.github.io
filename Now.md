### What I am up to now
<br/>

* Working remote for Sittercity and traveling to Chicago a few times a year. Definitely one of my favorite companies and favorite city.

* Living in Apex NC; about equidistant from Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill. The spring weather here is wonderful. Getting to downtown is a short, few minutes walk for coffee and food. Mostly, I work from home and local coffee shops, but I enjoy taking public transit occasionally to Durham and Raleigh for some co-working. We recently got rid of our second car.

* Lately have been building functional domain models to implement workflows that express business logic. There have been some challenges getting FP to play nicely with Android architecture that is biased towards OO implementation.

* Am evaluating bumping unit tests from JUnit4 to JUnit5. We have so many unit tests that depend on Robolectric though. Robolectric is not compatible with JUnit5 just yet. Also looking hard at the Spek framework for BDD.

* The goal for both of these efforts is to communicate better with all of the app stakeholders so that everyone can evaluate business logic using the same set of artifacts.
